/**
 * Created by Shivangi on 8/3/2017.
 *
 * We're going to make our own Contacts application! The application must perform two types of operations:
 *
 * add name, where name is a string denoting a contact name. This must store  as a new contact in the application.
 * find partial, where partial is a string denoting a partial name to search the application for. It must count the
 * number of contacts starting with partial and print the count on a new line.
 *
 * Given n sequential add and find operations, perform each operation in order.
 *
 * Input Format
 * The first line contains a single integer,n , denoting the number of operations to perform.
 * Each line i of the n  subsequent lines contains an operation in one of the two forms defined above.
 *
 * Output Format
 * For each find partial operation, print the number of contact names starting with partial on a new line.
 *
 * Sample Input
 * 4
 * add hack
 * add hackerrank
 * find hac
 * find hak
 *
 * Sample Output
 * 2
 * 0
